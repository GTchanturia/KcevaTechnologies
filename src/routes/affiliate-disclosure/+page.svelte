      <h2>Transparency is Our Priority</h2>
      <p>
        At Kceva AI Daily, we believe in complete transparency about how we operate and earn revenue. This page explains our 
        affiliate relationships and how they may affect you.
      </p>
      
      <h2>What Are Affiliate Links?</h2>
      <p>
        Affiliate links are special URLs that contain a unique tracking code. When you click on an affiliate link and make a purchase, 
        we may receive a commission from the company whose product you purchased. This is how we keep Kceva AI Daily free for all users.
      </p>
      
      <h2>How We Use Affiliate Links</h2>
      <p>Many of the links on Kceva AI Daily are affiliate links. Specifically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Deal Links:</strong> Links to AI tool providers and software platforms</li>
        <li><strong>"Get Deal" Buttons:</strong> Call-to-action buttons on deal pages</li>
        <li><strong>Product Recommendations:</strong> Links within our content and reviews</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Important Information</h2>
      <div class="bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 border-l-4 border-brand-blue p-4 my-6">
        <p class="font-semibold mb-2">ℹ️ Key Points to Know:</p>
        <ul class="mb-0">
          <li><strong>No Extra Cost:</strong> Using our affiliate links never costs you more. You pay the same price as going directly to the provider.</li>
          <li><strong>Sometimes Better Deals:</strong> We often negotiate exclusive discounts available only through our links.</li>
          <li><strong>Honest Recommendations:</strong> We only promote products and services we believe provide value.</li>
          <li><strong>Editorial Independence:</strong> Our affiliate relationships do not influence our editorial decisions.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <h2>How Commissions Work</h2>
      <p>
        When you click an affiliate link and make a purchase, the company may pay us a commission. This can be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A percentage of the sale amount</li>
        <li>A fixed fee per sign-up or purchase</li>
        <li>A recurring commission for subscription products</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The commission amount varies by provider and product but does not affect the price you pay.
      </p>
      
      <h2>UTM Parameters and Tracking</h2>
      <p>
        Our affiliate links include UTM parameters (e.g., ?utm_source=kcevadaily) for tracking purposes. These help us:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Know which deals are most popular</li>
        <li>Understand which content is most valuable to you</li>
        <li>Receive proper credit for referred sales</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Redirect Notice</h2>
      <p>
        When you click on a deal link, you may be briefly redirected through our tracking system (via URLs like /r/deal-id) 
        before being sent to the destination website. This allows us to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Log clicks for analytics (no personal data is stored)</li>
        <li>Add appropriate UTM tracking parameters</li>
        <li>Ensure you receive any exclusive discounts</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This redirect happens in less than a second and is transparent to you.</p>
